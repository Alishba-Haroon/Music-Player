# My project is a simple Music Player GUI application developed using Python's Tkinter library for the interface and Pygame's Mixer module for audio playback. The application allows users to open and play MP3 and WAV audio files, with basic playback controls such as play, pause, next, and previous. The GUI features a song label to display the currently playing track, buttons to navigate through the playlist, and an option to open new songs. This project aims to provide a straightforward and user-friendly music playback experience.
